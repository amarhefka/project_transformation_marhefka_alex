## Resources

## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this assignment and in the syllabus.

## Comments
There's an error in the Unicorn validator regarding a stray <script> tag, but it's not actually present in my HTML file. It seems to be related to my web host, as I don't receive this error when I validate my index.html via file upload. (See Explanation.docx for further, unrelated comments.)
